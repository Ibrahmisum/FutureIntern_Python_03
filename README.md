# Python Snake Game  

This project is a graphical implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's `tkinter` library. Players control a snake that grows in length every time it eats food, with the goal of surviving as long as possible without colliding with walls or itself.  

## Features  
- **Snake Movement**: The snake moves continuously in the chosen direction.  
- **Food Generation**: Randomly generates food items that increase the snake's size and score.  
- **Score Display**: Displays the player's score during gameplay.  
- **Game Over**: Ends the game when the snake collides with itself or the game boundary.  

## How It Works  
1. The game starts with a snake of three body parts.  
2. The player controls the snake using arrow keys:  
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left.  
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right.  
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up.  
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down.  
3. When the snake eats food, its length increases, and the score increments by 1.  
4. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the edges of the window.  

## Example Gameplay  
1. **Start the game**: The snake begins moving automatically in the downward direction.  
2. **Eat food**: Navigate the snake to the food to grow in length and increase your score.  
3. **Avoid collisions**: If the snake hits itself or the walls, the game ends, displaying a "GAME OVER" message.  

## Prerequisites  
- Python 3.x installed on your system.  
- `tkinter` module (comes pre-installed with Python).  

## Running the Program  
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.  
3. Run the program using the following command:  
   ```
   python snake_game.py  
   ```  

## Controls  
- **Arrow Keys**: Use the arrow keys (`Left`, `Right`, `Up`, `Down`) to change the snake's direction.  

## Notes  
- Ensure the `tkinter` library is installed and configured correctly.  
- The game's speed can be adjusted by modifying the `SPEED` constant in the script.
